# ALX Data Analysis Project1 Readme

## Introduction
This project was developed as a part of ALX Africa-Udacity Data Analysis NanoDegree Scholarship. It aims to make into practice acquired knowledge about data analysis process. </br>
The main task in the project was to: 
1. Introduce the dataset to be analyzed and search for relevant questions to be answered
2. Process data wrangling by gathering , assessing and cleaning data
3. Run eploaratory data analysis to answer a set of questions via visualizations and removing ouliners
4. Drawing conclusion and communicating limitations 

## Dataset to be analyzed
The dataset to be analyzed in this project is "No-show appointmennts". "This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil". It is about people who scheduled a doctor appointment then they showed up or not depending on several criteria that will discovered through the data analysis process. </br> The dataset contans 14 columns with relevant data to be analyzed to predict if a new patient will show up or not. </br>

The dataset header is very clear and no need to clarify the columns further. </br>

The No-show category is encoded to No/Yes. Through this project, it will be encoded to show column with 1 for No(no-NoShow==Show) and 0(yes-NoShow=Did not show up) for Yes. This will make the analysis easier rahter than analysing two negative logics. </br>

Scholarship column "indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in The Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia"

The dataset is uploaded in the project as a CSV file
